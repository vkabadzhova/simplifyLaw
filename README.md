âœ¨ Hey all! Welcome to SimplifyLaw! âœ¨

> _**Feel free to contact me**_ for any questions related to the project, including those questions you think are "stupid" (such as "how do I run that?"). It is pretty tricky; I am so grateful you're even here reading this, so I'll be _more than happy to help_:)

## Description

SimplifyLaw is a browser extension designed to make legal jargon more accessible. It helps users understand the law by directly explaining legal terms and phrases in their browser.
